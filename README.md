## Object Oriented Programming

Here is another July 28th, 2023 Python learning journal entry. Please see the README from the previous repo for more info on the charted course. My goal for the remainder of Jose Portilla's Python boot camp is to complete the course as directed, but branch off into side projects in Python after I'm done with the course. I think that will prove to be a more effective way of building a solid Python foundation before I proceed on the main road of machine learning and my eventual attempt to gain a TensorFlow certification.

I have created another repo for my Python side projects. The README there will detail all of my exploits.

I would also like to share something here. I have made a pledge to myself to _not_ watch any football games in my apartment this football season. My goal for this pledge is to remove a massive time-wasting obstacle to my learning. We'll see how that goes.
